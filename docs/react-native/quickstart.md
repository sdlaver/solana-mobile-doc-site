# Create a project

We recommend starting with a Solana Mobile template app generated by [`create-solana-dapp`](https://github.com/solana-developers/create-solana-dapp).

The Solana Mobile templates include:
- React Native (via Expo)
- Mobile Wallet Adapter and Solana RPC examples
- Pre-built components, navigation, and React hooks


## Initialize

To create a new project, run the following command:

```bash
npm create solana-dapp@latest
```

## Select the Solana Mobile framework

Select the Solana Mobile framework, then pick a template option.

## Next step

Now you have a project, set up your development environment so you can build and run your app.
