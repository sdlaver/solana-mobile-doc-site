# Environment Setup

Solana Mobile devices run Android OS, and the Solana dApp Store accepts only Android apps (APKs). 

To develop for Solana Mobile, you'll need an Android development environment.


## Expo

Expo is the officially recommended framework to build React Native apps.

For Solana Mobile development, we recommend this Expo setup:
- Android (required)
- Development Build (required for Mobile Wallet Adapter)
- Build without EAS

View Expo [**documentation**](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local) to setup your environment for Android development.

## Next steps

With your development environment ready, you can now test your Solana Mobile app on any Android device or emulator - no Seeker required.
