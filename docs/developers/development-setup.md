# Development Setup

This section covers the steps to:
- Set up your local environment for Android development.
- Configure a device or emulator for building apps for the dApp Store.
- Install an MWA-compliant wallet app for development purposes.


## Set up Android development environment

To build apps for the dApp Store, you need to setup your environment for Android development.

:::info Supported Frameworks

For both Expo or React Native Android development:
- View the Expo [**setup documentation**](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=physical&mode=development-build&buildEnv=local) (Choose custom development build instead of Expo Go).

For Kotlin Android development:
- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).

## Setup Device/Emulator

You can test your app during development on any Android device or emulator. A Solana Mobile device is **not** required for dApp Store developmentâ€”testing on a standard Android device is typically sufficient.

For detailed device setup instructions, refer to Android's official documentation:

- [Setting up a physical device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device)
- [Configuring the Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator)

## Install a development wallet app 

The [Mobile Wallet Adapter](/mobile-wallet-adapter/overview) (MWA) library allows your app to connect and interact with compatible wallet apps on your device. 

Install an MWA-compatible wallet app to test your app's Mobile Wallet Adapter integration.

### Fake Wallet

Solana Mobile provides a 'fake' development wallet for you to test your app with and get a feel of what Seed Vault Wallet interactions on the Seeker will look like.

The fake wallet features:
- Mobile Wallet Adapter support
- Simulate connection or signing errors
- QR Code Scanning for MWA Remote Connections

It is intended for development purposes only, so it does not store a persistent keypair and the wallet is reset each time the app is exited.

<summary>Installation steps</summary>

1. Clone the Mobile Wallet Adapter repo, containing the `fakewallet` app from the [github repository](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter)

```
git clone https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter.git
```

2. In Android Studio, `Open project > Navigate to the cloned directory > Select mobile-wallet-adapter/android/build.gradle`

3. After Android Studio finishes loading the project, select `fakewallet` in the build/run configuration dropdown in the top right

4. After it builds successfully, you should see the app on your connected Android device or emulator.
