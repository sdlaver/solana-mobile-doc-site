DEVELOPER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS TO CEASE USE OF THE SOLANA MOBILE PROPERTIES

15. <u>​Indemnification</u>. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Developer agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Solana Mobile and the Solana Mobile Parties from and against all actual or alleged third party claims, damages, awards, judgments, losses, liabilities, obligations, penalties, interest, fees, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses) and costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs of settlement, and costs of or associated with pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and nature whatsoever arising out of or related to this Agreement or your use of the dApp Publishing Platform, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, or suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract or otherwise (collectively, “**Claims**”), including, but not limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to (a) any Developer Assets, (b) Developer’s use of any Solana Mobile Properties, (c) Developer’s obligations under Section 5, (d) any breach of any EULA between Developer and any End User; and (e) any breach of this Agreement. Developer agrees to promptly notify Solana Mobile of any third-party Claims and cooperate with the Solana Mobile Parties in defending such Claims. Developer further agrees that the Solana Mobile Parties shall have control of the defense or settlement of any third-party Claims.

16. <u>General Provisions</u>

    16.1. **Notices**. All notices hereunder shall be made as follows:

       16.1.1. If to Developer: by email to the email address Developer provided to Solana Mobile when Developer registered for an account on the dApp Publishing Platform, or another address as subsequently designated by Developer according to the notice provisions hereof.

       16.1.2. If to Solana Mobile: [legal@solanamobile.com,](mailto:legal@solanamobile.com) or another address as subsequently designated by Solana Mobile according to the provisions hereof. Notices will be effective one (1) day after sending to the above email address(es).

    16.2. **Relationship of the Parties**. Developer and Solana Mobile are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or should be construed to, create a partnership, agency, joint venture or employment relationship between the parties. Neither party is or shall represent itself as an agent, legal representative, employee, or partner of the other party.

    16.3. **No Waiver**. If one party does not enforce a legal right or remedy available to it under this Agreement or Applicable Laws, that failure will not be considered a waiver of its right to enforce those rights or remedies in the future.

    16.4. **Injunctive Relief**. Developer’s obligations under this Agreement are of a unique character that gives them particular value; breach of any of such obligations will result in irreparable and continuing damage to Solana Mobile for which there will be no adequate remedy at law; and, in the event of such breach, Developer agrees that Solana Mobile will be entitled to injunctive relief, and such other and further relief as may be proper (including monetary damages if appropriate).

    16.5. **Governing Law**. This Agreement and the parties’ relationship hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its choice of law provisions. Subject first to Section 16.6, the parties agree to bring and maintain any litigation related to this Agreement exclusively in New York, New York. The parties expressly submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. The parties specifically disclaim the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be deemed modified to the extent necessary so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

    16.6. **Arbitration**. The parties agree to resolve all disputes arising under or in connection with the Agreement through binding arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party. The parties will use good faith efforts to resolve the dispute directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”). The arbitration will be conducted in English in New York, New York. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the applicable rules of the AAA for the appointment of an arbitrator. The selection of an arbitrator under the rules of the AAA will be final and binding on the parties. The arbitrator must be independent of the parties. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding on both parties, and the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The costs and expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by both parties; however, if the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 16.6 will not prohibit either party from: (i) bringing an individual action in small claims court; (ii) seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction if so permitted under this Agreement; (iii) pursuing an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; or (iv) filing suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claim. If this Section 16.6 is found to be unenforceable, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16.5 will govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreement.

    16.7. **Government Rights**. Solana Mobile provides the dApp Publishing Platform, including any related software, data, and technology, for ultimate government end use solely in accordance with the following: The dApp Publishing Platform shall constitute “commercial” computer software. Government technical data and software rights related to the dApp Publishing Platform include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in the Agreement. These customary commercial licenses are provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and FAR 12.212 (Customer-Side Application) and, for Department of Defense transactions, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data – Commercial Items) and DFAR 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Customer-Side Application or Computer Customer-Side Application Documentation). If a government agency has a need for rights not granted under these terms, it must negotiate with Solana Mobile to determine if there are acceptable terms for granting those rights, and a mutually acceptable written addendum specifically granting those rights must be included in any applicable agreement.

    16.8. **Export Regulations**. Developer is responsible for ensuring that its provision of Developer Assets to Solana Mobile and its offer of Developer Applications to its End Users on or through the dApp Store as contemplated by this Agreement does not and will not violate the Export Administration Regulations of the United States Department of Commerce or any other applicable U.S. government regulation regarding the export or re-export of United States source technical information as well as similar trade and export laws and regulations of Developer’s country.

    16.9. **Force Majeure**. Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party will not be considered a breach of this Agreement if such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire, earthquake, flood, epidemic, pandemic, or any other event beyond the control of such party, provided that such party uses reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the other party of the cause of such delay and to resume performance as soon as possible.

    16.10. **No Publicity**. Developer shall not make any public statement, press release, or other announcement relating to any Solana Mobile Properties (including, without limitation, the dApp Store) or this Agreement without the prior written approval of Solana Mobile, except as required by law.

    16.11. **Entire Agreement**. Except as otherwise supplemented and amended, as provided in the introduction hereto, all terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, together with the Product Guidelines and any exhibits, which are incorporated by reference into the Agreement, contains the entire agreement between Developer and Solana Mobile with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between Developer and Solana Mobile.
